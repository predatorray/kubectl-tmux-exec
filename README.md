A kubectl plugin that controls multiple pods simultaneously using [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux).

![screenshot](../assets/screenshot.png?raw=true)

It is to `kubectl exec` as `csshX` or `pssh` is to `ssh`.

Instead of `exec bash` into multiple pod's containers one-at-a-time, like `kubectl exec pod{N} /bin/bash`.

You can now use

```sh
kubectl tmux-exec -l app=nginx /bin/bash
```

## Installation 

### Homebrew

> **Note**: This is for Mac users only.

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

2. `brew install predatorray/brew/kubectl-tmux-exec`

The script should be installed under `/usr/local/bin/kubectl-tmux_exec` by default. Please ensure the `bin` directory is in your `$PATH` environment variable.

### Krew

> **Note**: It is recommended for Linux users.
> 
> Although it works both on Mac and Linux, it is not recommended for Mac users, since you still may need to install the dependency `gnu-getopt` with the help of Homebrew.

1. Install [Krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/) by following [the user guide](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/).

2. `kubectl krew install tmux-exec`

3. Install the dependencies. ([Wiki: How-to-Install-Dependencies](https://github.com/predatorray/kubectl-tmux-exec/wiki/How-to-Install-Dependencies))

### Manually

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/predatorray/kubectl-tmux-exec/releases/latest).

2. Unpack the kubectl-tmux-exec-*.tar.gz file and copy all the files to a directory, `/usr/local/kubectl-tmux-exec` for instance.

3. Add the `bin/` directory to PATH. For example, add this line to your rc file: `export PATH="$PATH:/usr/local/kubectl-tmux-exec/bin"`.

4. Install the dependencies. ([Wiki: How-to-Install-Dependencies](https://github.com/predatorray/kubectl-tmux-exec/wiki/How-to-Install-Dependencies))

## Usage

To execute this script as a [plugin]((https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/)), a `kubectl` version prior to `1.12.0` is required and the latest version is preferred. Alternatively, you can also execute the script directly like `kubectl-tmux_exec [...ARGS]` if it is not supported.

By executing the command below, you can check if the script has been successfully added.

```sh
kubectl plugin list
```

The output should be like

```txt
The following compatible plugins are available:

/usr/local/bin/kubectl-tmux_exec
```

If it does not show in the list, check `$PATH` env again.

You can use the command below to get the usage of the script.

```sh
kubectl tmux-exec --help

# or
kubectl-tmux_exec --help
```

### Options

Flag | Usage
--- | ---
`-V`<br>`--version` | Print the version information
`-l`<br>`--selector` | Selector (label query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. -l key1=value1,key2=value2)<br>You must either use `--selector` or `--file` option.
`-f`<br>`--file` | Read pod names line-by-line from a file.<br>You must either use `--selector` or `--file` option.
`-c`<br>`--container` | Container name. If omitted, the first container in the pod will be chosen
`-i`<br>`--stdin` | Pass stdin to the container (**deprecated**, since it's enabled by default)
`-t`<br>`--tty` | Stdin is a TTY (**deprecated**, since it's enabled by default)
`-d`<br>`--detach` | Make the Tmux session detached
`-n`<br>`--namespace=` | The namespace scope for this CLI request (can be applied multiple times)
`--context` | The name of the kubeconfig context to use (can be applied multiple times)
`-A`<br>`--all-namespaces` | If present, list and execute the requested object(s) across all namespaces. Namespace in current context is ignored even if specified with --namespace.
`-C`<br>`--enable-control-mode` | Start tmux in control mode and echo is disabled. (See: [iTerm2 Integration](#iterm2-integration))
`--remain-on-exit` | Remain Tmux window on exit
`--select-layout` | One of the five Tmux preset layouts: even-horizontal, even-vertical, main-horizontal, main-vertical, or tiled.
`--session-mode` | Where tmux is opened: auto, new-session, current-session

The usage of these options is also available by `--help`.

### Example

The `tmux-exec` is similar to `exec`, except that it requires label selectors while `exec` requires a pod name.

To `bash` into all pod containers that share some common labels, `foo=bar` for instance.

```sh
kubectl tmux-exec -l foo=bar /bin/bash
```

After you have successfully `bash`-ed into your selected containers, a Tmux window is opened actually, where each pane displays the execution result of each pod's container. Your keyboard inputs will be synchronized to all those panes.

If you are not familar with Tmux, you can have a look at tmux's man page or online tutorials. Or you can see the [cheatsheet](#tmux-cheatsheet) below, which will be sufficient I think.

### iTerm2 Integration

Since [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/index.html) has been [integrated with tmux](https://iterm2.com/documentation-tmux-integration.html), we can have a better native user interface, instead of remembering all the shortcuts.

All we have to do is to turn on the Control Mode, by adding the option `-C` / `--enable-control-mode` when executing the script. After that, the iTerm2 application will take full control of the tmux session.

For example, executing the commands below in an iTerm2 session

```sh
kubectl tmux-exec -C -l app=nginx /bin/bash
```

will result in something like the screenshot below.

![screenshot](../assets/screenshot-iterm2-integration.png?raw=true)

Note that, the `synchronize-panes` will be disabled automatically in this mode, since the iTerm2 provides a much easier way to achieve this. To turn this on, press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⌥</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd>, or click *"Shell"* - *"Broadcast Input"* - *"Broadcast Input to All Panes in Current Tab"* in the menu bar.

### Shell Auto-completion

Please check [this wiki](https://github.com/predatorray/kubectl-tmux-exec/wiki/Shell-Auto-completion) for more information.

### Tmux Cheatsheet

All Tmux command starts with a `PREFIX`. By default the `PREFIX` is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>b</kbd>. I will use `C-b` below to stand for it.

`C-b d`, detach from the session. After that, the Tmux will be running in the backgroud. You can type `tmux a` to re-attach.

`C-b :setw synchronize-panes off`, turn off synchronizing inputs to all panes.

`C-b :setw synchronize-panes on`, turn on synchronizing inputs to all panes.

`C-b <ARROW-KEY>`, move cursor between panes.

`C-b xy`, close the current pane.

`C-b &y`, close the window including all panes.
